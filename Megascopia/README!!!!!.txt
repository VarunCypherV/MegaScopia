Please note that this file is not part of our project but really important instructions for the same!!

1.The working directory of our application is a folder "Megascopia" on the Desktop.

Please create a folder "Megascopia"(Case sensitive) on the desktop and add all the supplied files to it WITHOUT creating any more folders inside

2.The main program file is labelled "MEGASCOPIA". All other files are just companion files for accessing this.

3.Please DO NOT tamper in any sort with the ".txt" files.
A slight character loss or a cursor dearrangement can cause all the program files to crash

4. this project was done on a tight time constraint and we put a lot of efforts in it. if any bugs or errors that slipped past our eyes ,please notify through this very same readme!!!!!.txt file so that we could kill it or sort it and put up an errorless application  which is our ultimate ambition .

5.As all these files and databases haven't been hosted on any server, the application uses your own computer's resources for the same.
Please check out the file "cssqlmodules.py" and edit the username and password for accessing the MySQL RDBMS.


THANK YOU AND BESH WISHES FOR HAPPY TIMES WITH OUR APP
